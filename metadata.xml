    <description>I plan on respriting most, if not all items currently in the game.

I'll work on and update this mod for uh, as long as I do

Items currently in the mod:
- The Sad Onion
- The Inner Eye
- Spoon Bender
- My Reflection
- Number One
- Brother Bobby
- Skatole
- Halo of Flies

All forms of feedback and criticism is appreciated! If there's any feedback you want to give me, or any suggestions on things you want to see changed, please tell me!

(More items will be added eventually, and I may go back to previously resprited items and change them further.)</description>
